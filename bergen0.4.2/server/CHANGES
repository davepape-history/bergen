snerd0.4alpha0

	added getDuration message to SampleFile class

alpha1

	Fixed SampleFile to call stop() when it reaches the end of a file (in
    read*Frames).  Previously, subsequent plays would do nothing, since it was
    stuck at the end of the file until an explicit "stop" command was received.
	Changed SampleFile to not mark itself as removeable unless it receives
    a "kill" command.  Before, it would allow itself to be removed if it failed
    to open the sample file; this caused problems with the new getDuration message -
    the client would wait forever for a reply from a now non-existent sound.
	Added "gain" command to main program, to allow setting an overall
    gain factor for the sound.

0.5
	Fixed bergenUDPSocket - needed to do an htons() on the port number.
	This makes it not backwards-compatible with previous versions' clients
on Intel machines (except by manually mangling BERGEN_PORT or the udpport
argument for snerd).  0.4 will not work properly when sending commands between
Intel & SGI machines.
