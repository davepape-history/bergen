To compile, edit the Makefile in each directory; make sure the 'include'
command at the top includes the appropriate file for your platform -
either Makedefs.sgi for IRIX, or Makedefs.linux for Linux.
Under Linux, if you do not have the audiofile library (libaudiofile),
change the "-DAUDIOFILE_LIBRARY" in server/Makedefs.linux to
"-UAUDIOFILE_LIBRARY".
